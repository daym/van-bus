VAN is a network used in the automotive environment

The bus is arbitrated and collisions are detected by CSMA/CA. Data is sent on the wire using Enhanced Manchester encoding.

The format of a VAN frame is described here, and we also have a description of the different idens and the format of our log files.

A description of VAN can be found in Protocols for Wired and Wireless Networks in Vehicle Systems.

VAN was also described on www.van-bus.org and www.van-mux.org . Those two sites are now gone. Thanks to the Wayback Machine we can still retrieve some info:

There are many interesting pages. Some documents were once downloadable. If you happen to have some of the MissingFiles on your HD, please drop us a note.

VAN datalink controllers:

Atmel seems the only producer of VAN datalink controllers. They were probably originally developed by Temic and then sold to Atmel.
