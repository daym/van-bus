#summary CRC15 polynomial

The polynomial for the VAN CRC is

    x^15 + x^11 + x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2

To translate it to a hexadecimal poly value, you will need to take a 15 bit value and write a one in each interesting bit position.

The 15 bits are numbered from 14 to 0 . The leftmost (MSB) bit represents x^14 (x^15 is implicit) and the rightmost x^0 (which must always be set in any CRC poly, so itâ€™s often not mentioned in the formula).

The result is:

    000111110011101

or

    0xF9D
